Supermarket

Implement the code for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of several items. In a normal supermarket, items are identified by ‘stock keeping units’ or ‘SKUs’. In our store, we will use individual letters of the alphabet, A, B, C etc, as the SKUs. Our goods are priced individually. In addition, some items have promotions of any of the following types:

*   Multipriced: buy n of them and which will cost you y. For example, item A
    
*   might cost 50 pence individually but this week we have a special offer where
    
*   you can buy 3 As for £1.30.
    
*   Buy n get 1 free
    
*   Meal deal: buy different items together and get a special price. For instance, items D and E might cost 150 and 200 pence each individually but this week we have a special offer where you can buy one of each for just £3.
